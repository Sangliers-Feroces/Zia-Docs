/*! \mainpage 
 * 
 * ZIA ARCHITECTURE
 * Zia is a modular HTTP server.
 * This interface is meant to make the modules.
 * This description is meant to explain the relationship between module kinds.
 * 
 * I - ILogger
 * The server accepts an arbitrary amount of loggers in conf. Upon a logged line, all loggers will be
 * called with such data as parameter.
 * 
 * II - IConnectionWrapper
 * The client connects to the server. A IConnection marked as default is created. If a single
 * IConnectionWrapper module is activated by conf, a new connection will be created around the base
 * connection using this module. The resulting connection becomes the default connection for
 * reading / writing from the client.
 * 
 * III - IParser
 * As the client connects, a parser instance is created from the parser module selected by configuration.
 * The server will regularely call IParser::IInstance::parse() to parse available bytes and make the parser
 * pass requests to the handlers.
 * 
 * IV - IHandler
 * The server accepts an arbitrary amount of handlers in conf. Each handler has a priority that can be overriden in conf.
 * When a request is received, the server tries to resolve it by calling IHandler::gotRequest on each handler. On the first
 * non-std::nullopt response, the request is marked as resolved and is written on the default connection.
 * 
 * V - ISniffer
 * The server accepts an arbitrary amount of sniffers in conf. Each sniffer will be called at each received request with
 * the request. Each sniffer will be called at each resolved request with the response and the associated request.
 *
